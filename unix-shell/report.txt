This assignment was done in a group consisting of Anthony Phelps and Michael Iadisernia.

Michael implemented the single_command function as well as all of the functions necessary for handling background processes
such as adding, checking and printing them.
Anthony implemented the multiple_commands function that can handle single pipe commands, multiple piped commands,
and multiple commands including input/output redirection.
 

ChatGPT was used to help us with this assignment in accordance with the rules of using generative AI 
in this course stated in the course outline. It was mostly used to help speed up implementing functionalities in C
because neither group members have much experience coding in C.

We also used geeksforgeeks.org to see examples of how to use many of the system calls in this assignemnet such as pipe, dup2,
open and close and the parameters that have to be passes to those system calls.

Prompts given to ChatGPT:

1) "I need to add to a skeleton shell program a built-in command jobs which lists the processes running in the background of the shell
 with their pid and the command launched.". ChatGPT suggested using a linked list to keep track of processes and also wrote the code for 
 typedef struct bg_process as well as the check_bg_process function.

 2) "How would I make my shell be able to handle piped commands?".
 This led to ChatGPT explaining the logic of the multiple_commands function and the conditions that had to be checked making it easier for 
 us to implement the function.
